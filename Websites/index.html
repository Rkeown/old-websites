            <p>Potholes are something we as Winnipegers should all know quite well</p>

            <p>Make a note of the fallen tree and the fact that you will need to change lanes <br>
                or that someone will have to change lanes into yours.</p>

            <p>Note that you will either have to change lanes or slow down to avoid the pothole. <br>

            <p>Notice the direction of the deer and recognise that it will most likely cross your lane, and you will
                need to slow down
