        <h1>So your webpages aren't loading?</h1>
        <p>
            Sadly there's not much I can do about that, the way
            this works is a very crude method. Seeing as the
            only other way I can think of creating the
            splitscreen effect is to make my own web browser
            and I'm not about to do that.

    <div class="questions"><h1>Why don't the pages load?</h1>
<p>
    The reason some pages don't load is because of the
    webpage itself. A lot of websites impliment something
    called "X-frame SAMEORIGIN", this prevents people using
    their site for a type of hack called clickjacking
